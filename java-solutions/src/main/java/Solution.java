   * 259. 3Sum Smaller
   * <p>
   * Given an array of n integers nums and an integer target,
   * find the number of index triplets i, j, k with 0 <= i < j < k < n that satisfy the condition
   * nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target.
   * <p>
   * Example 1:
   * <p>
   * Input: nums = [-2,0,1,3], target = 2
   * Output: 2
   * Explanation: Because there are two triplets which sums are less than 2:
   * [-2,0,1]
   * [-2,0,3]
   * Example 2:
   * <p>
   * Input: nums = [], target = 0
   * Output: 0
   * Example 3:
   * <p>
   * Input: nums = [0], target = 0
   * Output: 0
