I like solving algorithmic problems. 

In this repository, I decided to save for myself and share with everyone the solutions of the most interesting ones.
Problems in the repository are divided into directories according to the programming language in which the solution is described and into directories according to the subject of the problem

This repository is also collected for the algorithmic sections of the interview 
and contains a set of suitable tasks of varying levels of complexity (from very simple to very hard)

Also, I periodically share solutions on the [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/FLlGHT/) (solutions section)
